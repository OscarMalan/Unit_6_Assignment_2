    <h4>The Team</h4>
    <p>The team is a vital part of the company Hot Beans, without them we would never be able to make websites at the quality that we do!

    <p>Commenting on how big the team has grown, Nicholas Mayberry, Co-Founder of Hot Beans, said, “The fast growth of Hot Beans has been incredible, and we have been completely blown away by the volume of projects and support we receive. As our service grew and expanded, we expanded our team accordingly. With this rapid growth comes a need to remain highly agile, efficient and successful at the same rate.Commenting on how big the team has grown, Nicholas Mayberry, Co-Founder of Hot Beans, said, “The fast growth of Hot Beans has been incredible, and we have been completely blown away by the volume of projects and support we receive.

    <img src="../style/Person1.jpg" alt="Mic Dagger">
    <p>This is Mic Dagger, he is an incredible coder who has mastered coding in HTML, and PHP, two very useful and well written languages. He has spent many hours writing the programs for Phrontistery and thus has earned the right to be called the "fattest" coder we have on our team.</p>
    <img src="../style/Person2.jpg" alt="Linus Ginge">
    <p>Linus Ginge is a very talented commentor, who makes all of the code written easy to read, as well as being able to order all of the messages we get through the fax machine.</p>
    <p>Ole the guy from the next town, I don't think he's going to make it.</p>
    <p>The other week he phoned.</p>
    <p>Apparently he'd been on an archaeological dig in Mexico and had found a cell phone, wireless transmitter and GPS with a serial number beginning in "Z".</p>
    <p>He would, of course, need to return the phone before it was damaged beyond repair.</p>
    <p>So he told us.</p> 
    <p>"My house is on the market", I told him.</p>
    <img src="../style/Person3.jpg" alt="Dopey Mope">
    <p>Dopey Mope isn't always fully in the right headspace, and he still hasn't shown us any proof he can work in the UK, but hes pretty good at least.</p>
    <p>Ever heard of fire-singers?</p>
    <p>"The Amazing Deeds of Theobold" by Glay has been No.1 in the UK for a little while now, and I'm sure I wasn't the only one to not even give it a second listen after hearing it in the shower. Don't get me wrong, the electronic sounds and sampling are really cool, but the entire song is filled with Z-list melodrama and pub rock t-shirt imagery. I don't hate it; it's just rubbish</p>
    <img src="../style/Person4.jpg" alt="Karen Kamplain">
    <p>Karen Kamplain is our cleaner, shes pretty useless outside of that, can't even drive, but she has a nice face.</p>
    <img src="../style/Person5.jpg" alt="Will Simp">
    <p>Will Simp is our security, he is very talented at shouting people to get his wife's name out of their mouth, and slaps any intruders who even try to get in.</p>
