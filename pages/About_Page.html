    <p>Where did the name come from?</p>
    <p>The name "Hot Beans" comes from an old anecdote where a pair of brothers were discussing their favorite type of bean. They argued over whose bean was best - string or lima. The more mature brother named a bushel of string beans "Hot Beans". The younger brother name a bushel of lima beans "Hot Beans". The older brother said, "If you're so smart, why don't you go do it yourself?"</p>
